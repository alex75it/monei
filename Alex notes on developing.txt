## Account ##

In ApiController it is using User.Identity

in tests it is the logged user in the machin, it is not the right one.

From where it is obtained?
There is a read of the database, in which moment?
if it is good ok, but it must be injekted/moked, and pass the "account-id" HTTP header and reading user from database became pontless.
Otherwise it should not be used.

Specifically in ApiControllerbase class.
wher it is asked for the property CurrentAccount.
During debug of integration test of RegistryApiController (Monei.Test.IntegrationTest.MvcApplication.Api)

I found that there are "Users" and "Accounts" tables in database.
Which one is not used?

Try to rename "Users".
....



## Get Categories ##

GetCategories seems to make a lot of queries on database instead of just one.
